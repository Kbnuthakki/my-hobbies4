            My hobby is reading adventurous and fictional books.
            I like reading books because they pull us into a world of fantasy beyond our wildest imaginations.
            It seems so real that you would think it is a movie.
            Here are some facts about books.
            1.There are over 129 million books in existence.
            <br>
            2.The most expensive book ever purchased was sold for $30.8 million.
            It was Codex Leicester by Leonardo Da Vinci, and it was purchased by Bill Gates.
            <br>
            3.The longest sentence ever printed is 823 words.
            <br>
            4.Author’s names didn’t used to be printed on the covers of their books.
            The covers of the first printed books were considered artworks. They were covered in drawings, leather and even gold — so there wasn’t a place for the author’s name.
            <br>
            5.The three most read books in the world are…
            The Holy Bible, Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, and Harry Potter.
            <br>
            6.Alice in Wonderland is based on a real 10-year-old girl.
            Her name was Alice Liddell, and her family was close friends with author Lewis Carroll. While on a boating trip, she asked him to tell her a story — and that’s how Alice was born.
